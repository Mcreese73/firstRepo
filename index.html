    My College Experience

<!--My college life so far-->

<p> <indent>So far, my college experience has had ups and downs. </indent>
    In fact, I feel like there's a roadblock when something good happens.<br> 
    However, I'm pushing through.People say <q>after high school you start your life.</q>
    <br>The way I see it, your life really starts once you graduate college. <br>
    If I could work anywhere I want after I graduate, <br>
    I'm not sure what company I want to work at, but<br> 
    I want to be in both branding and advertising industries.
